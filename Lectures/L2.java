 *                                 Recap on Week 1
 * 
 * Programming Languages:
 * 
 *      1) High-level language, more human readable, easier to understand. However, 
 *         to run the code a middle man must help translate the High-level language
 *         to machine language.
 * 
 *         The translator is called "Compiler", a more modern compiler is called an
 *         "interpreter". Interpreter translate the code each line at a time while a
 *         "compiler" scan through the whole program and execute. This makes
 *         interpreter such as Python to debug faster.
 * 
 *      2) Low-level language, such as Assembly uses straight-forward instructions
 *         to the machine directly. However, this is difficult for human to underst-
 *         and.
 * 
 * 
 *  Code snippet:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *      class Hello {
 *          public static void main(String[] args) {
 *              System.out.println("Hello world.");
 *          }
 *      }
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Note: A class is a collection of various variables and methods that combine to
 *       form a useful purpose.
